	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a git repository and that allows you to make commits.


	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging are contains files you have selected and ready to be commited while
working directory contains all the files.


	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Make sure you add files to the staging area after any logical change and
commit the file before adding others to the staging area


	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
Branches can help you make an experimental feature, or a new language for your software.
with branches, you sure do want to keep your current software probably because it works 
perfectly, but at the same time you want to keep an open mind ... cooool!


	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams helped me to easily identify the parent commit, the unreachable commit,
and understand the detached head statement


	What is the result of merging two branches together?
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Truth is i wasnt able to merge due to the conflict problem. i know the steps,
and i will try to re-visit it.
Merging the branches together gives you the functionality of both.
The diagram is because instead of having just one parent, a merged file
has at least 2 parents.
