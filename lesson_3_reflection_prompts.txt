When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
~ When Im working on a huge project that i just cant afford to lose the codes
~ When Im working on the same project with other developers
~ When Im not working on my own pc
~ When Ive got issues with my pc



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
~ Changes might not be do exactly what you want
~ Some changes are presonal and you wont want it going out there
~ Might want to save some Memory space
